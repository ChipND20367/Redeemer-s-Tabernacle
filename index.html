          <h2>About Redeemer's Tabernacle</h2>
          <p class="muted">Redeemer's Tabernacle was 
            birthed from a divine vision entrusted to Pastor Peter Muteba Kazadi,
            a devoted servant of God originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo in Central Africa. While studying geology at the University of Lubumbashi,
               Pastor Peter experienced a life-changing encounter that would shape his destiny and future ministry.
               <br>
               <br>
               During his time at University, he attended a powerful evangelistic crusade led by Reinhard Bonnke.
                That moment stirred something profound within Him.
                There, pastor Peter cleary understood God's calling on his life to travel across nations, preach
                the gospel with fire, and plant churches that would bring hope, healing, and salvation to people 
                around the world. This calling became the foundation of what is now known as Redeemer's Tabernacle.

                <br>
                <br> Pastor Peter is blessed with a strong and supportive family.
                He is married to Nompilo, a South African woman of great character and faith.
                Together, they have been blessed with three beautiful children- two daughters,Leticia Kazadi,Owethu Kazadi and a son ,Praise Kazadi.
                Their family stands as a testimony to God's grace and unity across nations.<br>
                <br> Beyond his pastoral calling, Pastor Peter carries a deep passion for soul winning and a strong anointing for evangelism. He is also called to be an author, with a burning derise to write books that will inspire,equip, and transform lives for God's kingdom.
                <br>
                <br>
                From it's humble beginnings to it's growing influence, Redeemer's Tabernacle stands as a living testimony of God's faithfulness and one man's obedience to the divine call.
                The church continues to grow, touching lives, raising leaders, and reaching nations-fulfilling the mandate God placed upon its founder.

                </p>  
                <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
                <p class="muted"> Statement of faith is in total agreement with the foundational principles of the teachings of our Lord jesus Christ.
                  <br>1. Believe that the bible is the inspired word of God and infallible word of God. (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21) <br>
                      2. We believe that there is only one God, eternally existing in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. (Ephesians 4:5-6; Genesis 1:26, Matthew 3:16-17) <br>
                      3. We believe in rapture of the church and the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 19:11-16; Matthew 24:30-31) <br>
                      4. We believe in the divinity of Christ - (John 1: 1-4,John 10:30, Hebrews 1:1-5)
                          <ul class ="muted">
                            <li>He was born of a virgin. (Matthew 1:18-25)</li>
                            <li>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, (Matthew 1:18-25)</li>
                           <li> He died (John 19:30-35)</li>
                           <li> He rose again from death (John 20:25-29)</li>
                           <li> He ascended into heaven (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)</li>
                       </ul>
                       </p>
                <p class = "muted"> 
                  5. We believe that the only means of being cleansed from sin is repentance and 
                  faith in the precious blood of Jesus Christ. (Acts 3:19; Romans 5:9; 1 John 1:7, Luke 24:47; Ephesians 1:7) <br>
                  <br> 6. We believe in the regeneration by the power of the Holy Spirit. Through the word of God is
                   essential for personal salvation. (John 3:5-8; Titus 3:5; Ephesians 5: 25-27) <br>
                   <br> 7. We believe that the cross provides divine healing for the body, salvation for
                    the soul of everyone who belives.(1 Peter 2:24; Acts 3:16; Acts 9:32-35)  
                    <br>
                   <br> 8. We believe that when an individual receives the Holy spirit, he receives divine enablement for christian service and witness.(Acts 1:8; Acts 9:32-35)
                   <br>
                   <br> 9. We believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 15:16; 1 Corinthians 6:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:23) <br>
                   <br> 10. Then, we believe in the final ressurectio of both the saved and the lost. The former to eternal life and later to eternal judgement.(Revelation 20:11-15; John 5:28-29; Daniel 12:2; 1 Corinthians 15:12-23)
